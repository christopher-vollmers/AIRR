# AIRR

This repository contains scripts and sequence files to parse Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire (AIRR) data generated by IgBlast using output format 19. 
It also contains a script that will group AIRR data into clonal lineages.

This is academic software written by me and my lab and comes with no guarantees. On the bright side, I do my best to reply to email. Best way to get me to help is vollmers@ucsc.edu

Best,
Chris
